def standings_gas_solubility(pressure: float, temp: float, oil_api: float, sg_gas: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the gas solubility (Rs) in oil using Standing's Correlation.

    Standing's Correlation is an empirical relationship widely used in petroleum engineering
    to estimate the solubility of natural gas in crude oil under given pressure and temperature
    conditions.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    pressure : float
        Pressure of the fluid in psia
    temp_c : float
        Temperature of the fluid in degrees Rankine
    oil_api : float
        API gravity of the oil, indicating its density (Â°API)
    sg_gas : float
        Specific gravity of the gas relative to air

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        Gas solubility (Rs) in the oil at the given conditions, expressed in standard cubic
        feet of gas per barrel of oil (scf/bbl)

    Notes:
    ------
    - This correlation assumes the oil is undersaturated (i.e., pressure below bubble-point pressure)
    - The temperature is converted to Rankine for internal calculations
    - Ensure input values are within the correlation's validity range to maintain accuracy

    Example:
    --------
    >>> standings_gas_solubility(pressure=2000, temp=600, oil_api=35, sg_gas=0.8)
    550.32
    """

    exponent: float = 0.0125 * oil_api - 0.00091 * (temp - 460.67)
    solubility = sg_gas * ((pressure / 18.2 + 1.4) * (10 ** exponent)) ** 1.2048

    return solubility
